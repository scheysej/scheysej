## Hello There!

Unfortunately, I am not General Kenobi, I am just a Computer Science student at the Univeristy of Detroit Mercy with a passion for coding and learning new things.

### Current Project 🖥️
I am currently working on a university wide, collaborative project that will allow faculty to submit reimbursement tickets through a website, instead of doing it by hand like they have been.

### Language Experience 📚
